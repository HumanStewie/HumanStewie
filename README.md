#WordFlex Program
Recently learned arrays and I wanted to try it out so here's a simple program that generate 4 words as you press enter. 

#Things I might add in the future (if I'm not lazy)
-> True Random Words (Currently it repeats words that were already given)

#Note
This is more like a library of small projects that I do to get used to Git and Github. Alongside that, I can save my projects in many repository and I can come back to check it out in the future. In general, it's my study diary.
